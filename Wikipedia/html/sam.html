                Samantha was born on 28 April 1987 to a Telugu father, Joseph Prabhu and a Malayali mother,
                Ninette Prabhu.[4][5] She was born and brought up in Chennai, Tamil Nadu,[6] as the youngest
                child of the family, with two elder brothers Jonathan and David, whilst becoming fluent in the
                Tamil language. Despite her mixed background, she has cited herself as a Tamilian.[7][8] As a
                part of her education, Samantha was schooled at Holy Angels Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School
                and then completed a degree in commerce at Stella Maris College, Chennai.[7][9] Towards the end
                of her undergraduate degree she became involved in modelling, notably working with Naidu Hall,
                through which she was first spotted by filmmaker Ravi Varman.[citation needed]

                Debut, breakthrough and critical acclaim (2010-2012)

                Samantha in her early career
                Samantha began her professional film career with Gautham Vasudev Menon's Telugu film, Ye Maaya
                Chesave (2010). The film, simultaneously made in Tamil as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), was
                highly anticipated prior to release, primarily due to the first-time-collaboration between Gautham
                Menon and composer A. R. Rahman.[10] The actress successfully auditioned and was signed up for the
                project in August 2009. The film was shot in India and the United States, and it released on 26
                February 2010.[11] Post-release, she revealed that Menon played a "crucial part in moulding her as
                an actress", teaching her how to remain natural and comfortable in front of the screen, even if she
                had no dialogues in a scene.[12] In the film, Samantha played the lead character Jessie, a Malayali
                Saint Thomas Christian girl living in Hyderabad, with whom the male protagonist, played by Naga
                Chaitanya, falls in love. Upon release of the film, Samantha received highly positive reviews for
                her portrayal, with the film itself garnering widespread critical acclaim.[13] Critics at Sify
                praised Samantha as a "scene-stealer" and her beauty as "alluring", adding, "she was the girl to
                watch out for."[13] Jeevi from Idlebrain.com, wrote that "Samantha's debut is one of the best
                heroine debuts in Telugu cinema" and noted that the "minute expressions she gave spoke volumes about
                her", whilst labelling the film as a "classic". Her performance in Ye Maaya Chesave earned her first
                nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu and won her the Filmfare Award for Best
                Female Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[14][15][16] Samantha appeared in a cameo role
                in the Tamil version of the film, portraying an assistant director who becomes an actress.[17] Both
                the Telugu and the Tamil versions of the films proved to be major successes, propelling Samantha to
                stardom.[18] She followed up her collaborations with Gautham Menon and A. R. Rahman by appearing in
                the music video for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 promotional song, Semmozhiyaana
                Thamizh Mozhiyaam, which Menon directed and Rahman composed.[citation needed]

                Samantha's next release was the romantic drama, Baana Kaathadi (2010), opposite Adharvaa. The film
                was actually the third Tamil project signed by the actress, but its release preceded the first two
                that she was contracted for due to delays in their completion.[19][20] Samantha portrayed a student
                of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the first such role in Tamil cinema.[21] Her
                next release was Ravi Varman's Moscowin Kavery (2010), originally the first film she began work on.
                The shooting for the film began in August 2007, with Samantha, then briefly credited with the screen
                name Yasodha, joining the team later in the year.[22] In an interview held in 2008, Ravi Varman
                mentioned that he had decided that Samantha would be the lead actress for his film within three
                minutes after viewing one of her commercial assignments.[23] He went on to describe her as an
                actress with "intelligence" and "potential", whilst drawing comparisons with the noted actress,
                Revathi.[23] However, due to Ravi Varman's prior commitments as cinematographer in other projects,
                the film languished in development hell, eventually releasing in August 2010.[24] The film earned
                negative reviews from critics, though Samantha's performance was credited as one of the sole
                highlights that the film offered.[25] In August 2008, while still completing her last three
                projects, Samantha also signed up to play the lead role of a modern girl in the Narain-starrer,
                Pookada Ravi, which was later shelved.[26][27] Samantha then went on to feature in Vamsi
                Paidipally's Telugu film Brindaavanam (2010) in which she played a supporting role alongside NTR Jr
                and Kajal Aggarwal. Her performance as Indu was well-received despite having a shorter screen time,
                and the film became her second successful venture in Telugu.

                Samantha featured in the big-budget Telugu film, Dookudu (2012) alongside Mahesh Babu, which became one
                of the most successful Telugu films of all time.[28] The film received positive reviews, with a critic
                from The Times of India stating "Samantha looks beautiful and has done a great job, though her role as
                Prashanthi isn't too lengthy."[29] She received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best
                Actress – Telugu for her performance in the film. She also subsequently made guest appearances in two of
                Gautham Vasudev Menon's films, first in the psychological thriller film, Nadunisi Naaygal (2011) as a
                mental asylum inmate and then repeated her role from Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa in the Hindi version of
                the film, Ekk Deewana Tha (2012). Her popularity in Telugu films led to Nadunisi Naaygal was dubbed and
                released in Telugu as Eera Gulabeelu, with Samantha featured prominently on the film's posters, despite
                only having a guest appearance.[30] During the period, Samantha had also been signed two big-budget
                projects in Tamil, Mani Ratnam's Kadal (2013) and Shankar's I (2015), but was forced to opt out from
                both films, since she was suffering from a skin disease and could not work for two months during
                mid-2012.[31][32][33] Samantha next featured in S. S. Rajamouli's live action Telugu-Tamil bilingual
                project Eega (2012) alongside Nani and Sudeep, portraying a micro artist who runs a NGO and takes
                revenge for the murder of her lover.[34] As the film featured a CGI-created housefly as the main
                character, Samantha noted that she had to use her imagination and act accordingly. She also revealed
                that many heavy lights were used for the shoot of the film and she subsequently suffered skin burns,
                calling the process "very stressful" but "satisfying".[35] Titled Naan Ee (2012) in Tamil, the film
                opened to highly positive reviews and Samantha also won high critical acclaim for her performance. A
                critic from The Hindu noted "Samantha blooms in the role given to her," while Jeevi of Idlebrain.com
                wrote her "successful run continues as she protrays the role a bereaved lover with perfection".[36][37]
                Sify.com also praised her performance in the film, citing her "subtle expressions of love, fear and
                anxiety work well for the film" and that she "looks beautiful and has performed her role with consummate
                ease".[38][39] The film went on to become a major commercial success, grossing more than ₹ 1.25 billion,
                and went on to be dubbed in several foreign and Indian languages.[40][41][42]

                    style="float:left;padding:8px 10px 0px 10px;height:300px ;width:200px">

                Samantha then worked on Gautham Vasudev Menon's a trilingual romantic drama film and played the leading
                female role of Nithya in the Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi versions of the film, shooting scenes
                simultaneously back-to-back with three different actors. The Tamil version, Neethaane En Ponvasantham
                (2012) featured her alongside Jiiva, while Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu (2012) paired her opposite Nani. A
                further Hindi version titled Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau with Aditya Roy Kapoor was simultaneously shot with
                the other two films and was "60%" completed, before Menon shelved the venture after his other Hindi
                film, Ekk Deewana Tha, had failed at the box office.[43] The film spanned three periods in the life of a
                couple, focusing on their romantic relationship at school, college and in their late twenties. Samantha
                revealed that she knew Gautham would want to work with her again and immediately accepted the
                opportunity to portray the roles when she was offered the film. She felt that she "could relate to the
                attributes and the circumstances the character goes through" and described Nithya's character as "close
                to her."[44] To make her performance as authentic as possible, Samantha chose to dub for herself in the
                Tamil version of the film. The Tamil and Telugu versions of the film opened in December 2012, earning
                polarizing reactions. Neethane En Ponvasantham earned mixed reviews and performed averagely at the box
                office, though Samantha received highly critical acclaim for her portrayal. The critic from The Hindu
                noted she "comes up with possibly the best performance by a female lead in Tamil cinema this year" and
                "her transformation from a gawky teenager to an adult, unable to overcome her ego, is outstanding".[45]
                Meanwhile, IBN stated "Samantha's transformation from a school kid to an adult is a treat to watch,"
                while Rediff.com noted she is "pretty, graceful, and does an excellent job of conveying the emotions of
                a girl in love, especially during the school sequence, while concluding she carries the film on her
                slender shoulders."[46][47] The Telugu version, Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu, received positive reviews and
                did well commercially, while Samantha's performance again received high critical acclaim. The Hindu
                wrote she "goes a step further from her famous portrayal of Jessie (Ye Maaya Chesaave) and brings out
                the intricacy of her character well", while The Times of India wrote "Samantha has the author-backed
                role and she creams it."[48][49] At the 60th Filmfare Awards South, she subsequently won the Best
                Actress awards for both the Tamil and Telugu film industries for her performances in Neethane En
                Ponvasantham and Eega. Samantha became the second-ever actress to achieve the feat after Revathi had
                secured both awards in 1993.[50] 2012 became her most prolific award-winning year and she secured
                further accolades for Best Actress at the Vijay Awards, Santosham Film Awards and the CineMAA
                Awards.[51]
